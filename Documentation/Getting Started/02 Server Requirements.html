            <h1>Server Requirements</h1>
            <p>N2CMS is a comprehensive and complete CMS framework. However, there are a number of requirements that need to be satisfied in order for N2 to work properly. </p>
            <h2> Database Server</h2>
<p>N2 uses the NHibernate library for database connectivity. Consequently, N2 supports most engines supported by NHibernate:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
              <li>MySQL Server 5 and higher, with innodb support enabled</li>
              <li>PostgreSQL</li>
              <li>Firebird</li>
              <li>Oracle</li>
              <li>SQLite (not recommended in production)</li>
              <li>Microsoft Access (not recommended in production)</li>
              <li>SQL Server Compact (not recommended in production)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that even though N2 technically works with client-side database engines such as Microsoft Access, their use is generally <strong>not recommended </strong>because these databases lack the concurrency support that client/server databases typically offer. We recommend using either Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL. For support for object oriented and document oriented database engines, see <a href="http://www.n2cms.com/enterprise">N2 Enterprise</a>. Some legacy platforms such as IBM DB2 UDB are also supported; please consult the NHibernate documentation for more information if you want to use those. </p>
            <p>N2 makes use of <strong>foreign keys</strong> so you should select a database platform that supports those as well. For example, MySQL is supported but InnoDB support is required for foreign keys. N2 may work without foreign key support but undesirable and unknown effects may occur. </p>
            <h2>Application Server</h2>
            <p>N2 is written in C# and relies on the Microsoft .NET Framework with the following components installed: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Windows Server 2003 R2 or later (Windows Server 2008 R2 recommended)</li>
              <li>IIS with .NET 3.5 or 4.0 </li>
              <li>Microsoft ASP.NET MVC Framework 3.0 [which you can <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4211">download from Microsoft</a> if needed]</li>
              <li>Any database connectivity components required by your choice of database server above, for example:
                <ul>
                  <li>no additional install is required for MS SQL Server as the connectivity components are included in the Microsoft .NET Framework</li>
                  <li>MySQL Connector/NET if you wish to use MySQL</li>
                  <li>SQLite binaries if you wish to use SQLite </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>At least 128 MB of RAM required for the application pool and cache resources</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unfortunately, Mono is not supported at this time due to dependencies on the ASP.NET MVC Framework.</p>
            <p>Binaries for SQLite and MySQL connectivity may be included in your distribution of the N2CMS framework or NuGet package you used.            </p>
            <p> Note: If you are running Windows Server 2003 you may be able to get N2 to work but it will require a bit of extra effort. Get MVC working first, then deploy N2 CMS. You will need to install .NET 3.5 and/or .NET 4.0 and the MVC framework on your server if it is not already installed; doing this requires Administrator privileges.</p>
            <h3>Hosting Recommendations</h3>
            <p>We recommend that you purchase a hosting plan through <a href="http://www.n2cms.com/hosting">N2CMS Hosted Solutions</a>. A money-back guarantee is available, and your support helps the ongoing development of N2CMS!</p>
            <p>If you would like to run N2CMS on your own server, we recommend that you run N2CMS on a VPS with at least 1 GB of memory to support Windows Server 2008 R2 and all necessary components, or a dedicated server with similar specifications. </p>
            <p>Before purchasing web hosting with a third-party hoster, please ensure that it meets the stringent requirements above.  We do not guarantee compatibility with any particular third party web hosts, but people have reported success using GoDaddy, Arvixe Business Class, Drundo, and ReliableSite Semi-Dedicated packages. </p>
<h2>High Availability</h2>
            <p>N2 provides High Availability components, including load balancing and replication support, with <a href="http://www.n2cms.com/enterprise">N2 Enterprise</a>, available either as a hosted service or a software suite suitable for on-premise deployment. </p>
