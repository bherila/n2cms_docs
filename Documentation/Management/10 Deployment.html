            <h2>Keeping Production and Development Data in Sync</h2>
            <p>Once you deploy in production, you may or may not want to move away from using the default SQLite database engine. Either way, take care not to replace your production database with an older development database! We recommend that you periodically replace the database you use in development with copy of your production database so that you can experiment with your current production data. Your development and production instances of N2 do not necessarily need to be using the same database engine. We recommend that you use the import/export feature in the N2 administration area to first export your site to a file, and then import this file in your production setup. </p>
            <p><strong>Why not simple database replication?</strong> Because not all data is stored natively in the database, traditional database replication is not guaranteed to provide consistent replication of your N2 site data. The N2 import/export API handles all data, including data not stored in the database. </p>
            <p>Note: If the file is very large, you might not be able to upload the file to your development instance unless you change some configuration settings. See the related topic: <a href="/Documentation/Troubleshooting/File Upload Issues.html">File upload issues</a>. </p>
<h2>Streamlining deployment using ZipFS</h2>
            <p>The N2 administration area uses a number of small image files that can be burdensome to deploy over FTP. Furthermore, some hosting environment impose limitations on the total number of files hosted. To eliminate these small resource files, you can deploy a N2.ZIP file containing these resource files. The server will transparently extract this N2.ZIP file and serve the extracted files to clients on demand. </p>
            <p><strong>{content needs to be written}</strong></p>
            <p>Caveat: more memory used by the ZIP DLL. </p>
