<p>Lets take a quick look at what those definitions on the previous page does when we're in edit mode.</p>
<h2>Entering Edit Mode</h2>
<p>There are two ways of entering Edit Mode: </p>
<ol>
  <li>In the left pane of the Administration panel, right-click on a content item and select <em>Edit</em> from the context menu. </li>
  <li>On the N2 toolbar, click the Edit button as shown below:</li>
  </ol>
<p>[TODO:SCREENSHOT]</p>
<p>You are then taken to Edit Mode, where the various properties of the item you are editing are displayed. There are a variety of editor types, all of which are controlled by<strong> attributes</strong> on the classes you are editing. For more information on these editor types and how to create your own, see the <a href="/Documentation/Developer Guide/200 Editors/@Root.html">Editors</a> topic in the documentation. </p>
<h2>Editing Parts</h2>
<p>Each Part is displayed in the Edit Mode interface as an item within a zone. You can click on the [ICON:PENCIL] icon next to each item to edit that item in more detail, or you can use the [ICON:UP] and [ICON:DOWN] icons to move the item up or down within their current zone. Any changes to part alignment are saved immediately. </p>
<p>There is also a visual tool for editing the parts on a page. On the N2 toolbar, click the Edit Parts icon. When you mouse over any part, a handle is shown. You can click and drag the part up or down in its current zone, or to a different zone on the page. Note that parts can restrict what zones they participate in, and only valid target zones are displayed in the drag and drop interface. Again, changes are saved immediately. </p>
<p>You can also add new parts by clicking on the [ICON:PLUS] icon in the Edit Mode interface, or by</p>

<h3>Editing an item</h3>
            <UL>
              <LI>Now we are accessing the site's edit interface (/edit) and are editing the start page.&nbsp;</LI>
              <LI>Remember we defined a property named Text? Remember that we gave that property an attribute: <STRONG>Editable</STRONG>FreeTextArea? That attribute is interpreted by the N2 engine and a html editor is displayed when we edit the page without the need to write a single form.</LI>
            </UL>
            <h3>Labels on editable stuff</h3>
            <UL>
              <LI>That label saying Text is actually the parameter we gave to the attribute on the property. <BR>
              </LI>
            </UL>
            <h3>Attributes on content items</h3>
            <UL>
              <LI>While we're still remembering what we discussed in the previous chapter. The TextPage class was also decorated with an attribute: <STRONG>[Definition</STRONG>]. The attribute tells N2 what type of page is called when we are editing. In this GalleryItem we're creating a new item. </LI>
